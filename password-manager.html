            with a team of 3 other students to develop a secure password\
            manager as part of our System Security course. The application will\
            allow users to safely store the username & password for their online\
            accounts, and retrieve them with a master password (much\
            like <a href='https://lastpass.com'>LastPass</a>).</p>\
            <p>The main goal of this project is to gain experience developing a\
            system which meets certain security requirements (e.g., keeping\
            users' passwords confidential, authenticating users properly) so\
            that we would feel confident storing our own passwords and bank\
            information in this system.</p>"
