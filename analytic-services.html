            Security Studies & Analysis Institute (HSSAI)</a> at Analytic\
            Services Inc. in Arlington, VA. HSSAI conducts research on behalf\
            of the Department of Homeland Security. During my internship, I\
            built and analyzed a computer simulation of the flow of illegal\
            migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border. I taught myself NetLogo, a\
            programming language used for creating agent-based simulations. I\
            concluded the summer by writing a 45-page report on my findings and\
            presented my results to my mentor's team so they could build upon\
            my work in the future.</p>"
