	<h2>Flint</h2>
	<section class="content">
		<p>Flint seeks to bridge academic and experiential education by connecting students with established entrepreneurs <!--
			-->who will provide them with both guidance and real-world challenges. At its core, Flint is a mentorship program <!--
			-->between Cornellian students and experienced professionals and/or Cornell alumni. Flint is unique and highly <!--
			-->accessible in that it provides a convenient, interactive online platform upon which students and employers can <!--
			-->communicate with each other.</p>
		<br />
		<p>As CTO of Flint, I lead the software development team, which is responsible for the implementation of Flint's <!--
			-->website. The website is the main portal through which students and mentors find and connect with one another. <!--
			-->In addition to managing the team, I focus primarily on design and front-end programming for the website.</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="dark">
		<h3>The Design Process</h3>
		<p>Below are some of my working designs for Flint's website. The color red is used throughout the site because it <!--
			-->represents Cornell University. As Flint is currently open only to Cornell students, I chose a color that <!--
			-->reflect that community. A light shade of gray was chosen for the background because it is easier on the <!--
			-->eyes than a stark white without distracting from the content.</p>
		<br />
		<p>In designing the overall style and mood of Flint's website, I balanced the expectations of our two main user <!--
			-->bases: college students and alumni/entrepreneurs. College students typically prefer "modern" design elements <!--
			-->such as flatness, bold colors, and subtle animations. Flint aims to help students enter the professional <!--
			-->business world, so I preserved a decidedly grayscale design, with only key elements highlighted in Cornell <!--
			-->red. Depth and distinct layers establish context, making it clear to the user how elements relate to each <!--
			-->other.</p>
		<img src="../images/flint_home.png" class="large" />
		<br />
		<p>The center of attention within students' profiles are a list of cards, each representing a past job, experience, <!--
			-->or accomplishment. I plan to update the design shown below to better distinguish between differeent types of <!--
			-->cards, such as the About Me card versus that of a summer internship. In the future, profiles will also show <!--
			-->a student's mentors and friends so others can get insight into the student's professional and social networks.</p>
