            a 2d physics-based game in which the user must guide charged\
            particles to a target. Touching the screen creates a positive field\
            around your finger, attracting negative particles and repeling\
            positive ones.</p>\
            <p>I had a few goals in mind with this project. My main focus was\
            on the visual aspects of the game. I wanted everything from the\
            field your finger creates to the background to be built upon\
            beautiful particle effects. I had first discovered particle effects\
            when developing re:member, but the effects were not incorporated\
            into that game nearly as tightly as in Electrode.</p>"
