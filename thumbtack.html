            projects. With Thumbtack, customers can hire professionals\
            at just about anything, from painters to music teachers to\
            personal chefs. Reviews are a big part of the relationship between\
            customers and professionals.</p><p>I spent the majority of my summer\
            at Thumbtack improving the system by which reviews are collected\
            by and displayed to customers. This involved re-building the\
            \"Leave a Review\" page from scratch to match an updated design.\
            I also made sure the page looked perfect on devices of any size,\
            since a significant portion of Thumbtack's users visit their\
            website from their phones. I also added the ability for customers\
            to rate professionals not just on their overall service, but on\
            specific categories like \"Professionalism\" and \"Value.\"\
            These new features showed an increase in reviews received and the\
            value (to customers, professionals, and Thumbtack) of these\
            reviews.</p>"
