            is bringing computers to people in the developing world by creating\
            an operating system, ecosystem of applications, and inexpensive\
            computer hardware line. Endless focuses on user-centered design to\
            develop an operating system which is intuitive and suits the needs\
            of its customers, many of whom have never used a computer\
            before.</p>\
            <p>I worked on motion graphics and front-end programming for\
            Endless's operating system. I designed and implemented subtle\
            animations applied to microinteractions such as opening a window,\
            clicking a button, or showing a menu. The goal of these animations\
            was to delight users with a more polished interaction and to help\
            guide their eyes toward relevant UI elements such as a window that\
            just opened.</p>"
