            education by connecting students with established entrepreneurs who\
            will provide them with both guidance and real-world challenges. At\
            its core, Flint is a mentorship program between Cornell students\
            and experienced professionals and/or Cornell alumni. Flint is\
            unique and highly accessible in that it provides a convenient,\
            interactive online platform upon which students and employers can\
            communicate with each other.</p>\
            <p>As Software Lead of Flint, I lead the development of Flint's\
            website. The website is the main portal through which students and\
            mentors find and connect with one another. In addition to managing\
            the team, I focus primarily on design and front-end programming for\
            the website.</p>"
